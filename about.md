I'm a RPG geek. I've been playing/mastering RPG for the past 20+ years.


### More Information

#### My RPG curriculum

I started in the hobby with AD&D, than Shadowrun, Vampire: The Masquerade, Savage Worlds, Mutants & Masterminds, Cortex Plus, No Thank You Evil, Numenera, Cypher System, The Black Hack, Hero Kids and other I have probably forgot about.

I really love how, the Cypher System provides a great balance between simple rules, lazy GMing and heavy character options, but some of my players didn't rellay appreciate the system. Character creation simply offerred too many options.

So right now the group have settled on [The Black Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition). The rules are easier to digest for a group of old timers that don't have that much time to play (_We play once a month or so_).

I don't have that much time to play though, so I'm also an avid RPG reader. Yup, I love to read about new RPGs and inspire myself of their rules and settings. 

#### About my personal life

I'm a french canadian father of five wonderful children. I've started to play with the oldest one a couple of year ago and consider including the other ones too.

I'm an avid boardgamer too. Currently with my busy schedule they are easier to fit in.

I'm an IT professional, with more than 15 years of experience in develeopment, system administration, devops, cloud management and I recently change my scope to be an Agile Product Owner. So there might be a post or two about technological subject every now and then. But it won't be the norm.
