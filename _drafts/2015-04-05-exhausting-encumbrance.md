Ever since the D&amp;D 3e, I always felt that the provided encumbrance
system was somewhat off. The major problem I had was with the fact that
your load would affect your moving speed.  
  
But up until recently, I didn't know how to fix it, so I mainly ignored
that rule.  
  
Before, delving into my though, a little disclaimer :  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">I'm not a professional game designer, just
a dabbler. I don't have any personal experience to back up anything I
says here. Like hiking, military training or anything. Just so you
know.</blockquote><h3>Inspiration in the new edition� </h3>When D&amp;D
5e came out last summer, I was really please to see that the "default"
rules are somewhat simpler :  
  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">**Carrying Capacity**. Your carrying
capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters
don’t usually have to worry about it.  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">*Source : Dungeons and Dragons :
Player's Basic Rules Version 2.0*</span></blockquote>  
But, that rules are basically what I was already doing ... ignoring
carrying capacity all together. Reading further down the Basic Rules, I
saw the Variant Encumbrance rules I was psyched, until I realized that
they are basically what they always were and there main effect was to
slow down your movement.  
  
That's when I had the thought that carrying an heavy load doesn't affect
your walking speed as much as it affect the time you could walk with
that given load. So the size of your load should interact with your
fatigue rather than your walking speed, and when you are fatigued enough
that's when you walking speed will be affected.  
  
Keeping that in mind I continued my reading of the basic rules, and at
the same reflection when reading about the effect of wearing an heavy
armour.  
  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">**Heavy Armor**. Heavier armor interferes
with the wearer’s ability to move quickly,stealthily, and freely. If
the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength
column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10
feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the
listed score.  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">*Source : Dungeons and Dragons :
Player's Basic Rules Version 2.0*</span></blockquote>So, wearing an
heavy armor, confer the same penalty to it's wearer as if he was
carrying a medium load (reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet). Again,
that's not really what I think it should do, while you wear the armor,
you should be able to keep on going at the same speed, but just fatigue
quicker.   
<h3>A look into exhaustion</h3>It's when I read about the conditions in
the Appendix A, all added up together as I was reading about the
Exhaustion mechanism.  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">**Exhaustion**  
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as  
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching  
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called  
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect  
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as  
specified in the effect’s
description.</blockquote><blockquote>**Level**��� **Effect**  
1������������ Disadvantage on ability checks  
2������������ Speed halved  
3������������ Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws  
4������������ Hit point maximum halved  
5������������ Speed reduced to 0   
6������������ Death  
  
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes
exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount
specified in the effect’s description.  
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well
as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2
exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. 

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the
effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a
creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.  
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1,
provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">*Source : Dungeons and Dragons :
Player's Basic Rules Version 2.0*</span></blockquote>So, this exhaustion
sub-system is exactly how fatigue is build into the game, and it's a
good damn way of doing hit. Now the only thing to do is to merge
encumbrance with it.The way of doing it, is hinted by the forced march
rules, in the adventuring chapter.  
  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table
assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on
beyond that limit, at the risk of
exhaustion.�</blockquote><blockquote>For each additional hour of travel
beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour
column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution
saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past
8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of
exhaustion (see appendix A).  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">*Source : Dungeons and Dragons :
Player's Basic Rules Version 2.0*</span></blockquote>So, after walking
for 8 hours, what I call a strenuous activity, you make a constitution
saving throw to prevent being exhausted. The only thing next to do is to
extend the definition of that strenuous activity to include other
things.  
<h3>Looking into the strenuous activities </h3>  
Searching for the term "strenuous" in the Basic rules returns two hits,
both in the Resting section of the rules. The one in the definition of
the long rest in really interesting.  
  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">\[...\] If the rest is interrupted by a
period of<b> strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting,
casting spells, or similar adventuring activity— </b>the characters
must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. \[...\]  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">*Source : Dungeons and Dragons :
Player's Basic Rules Version 2.0*</span></blockquote>So, we have at
least some idea of what is a strenuous activity now. So, 8 hours of
walking could be counted as 8 strenuous activity in a day. And 8
strenuous activities without some kind of rest requires a Constitution
Saving throw against exhaustion.  
  
That 8 activities thought sounds a little bit of an arbitrary number. If
we take into account that a fight, or casting a spell is considered a
strenuous activity, it is likely that a character will perform some
other strenuous activities in a day of walk.  
  
So if we add a couple of activities to that 8, we end up with 10. The
same number used as the base of the Constitution saving throw (10 + 1
per a hours past the first 8). So, the DC is actually 1 per strenuous
activities done since the last long rest.   
  
10 is also the average Constitution score for humans. Coincidence or
not, I feel comfortable that the Constitution score of a character alter
the number of strenuous activities he can perform in a day.   
  
We now have the foundation for the basic rules governing strenuous
activities :  
<blockquote class=\"tr\_bq\">A character can make a number of strenuous
activities in a day equals to it's constitution score.   
Beyond that, he must start to make a Constitution saving throw against
exhaustion.  
The DC is equals to the number of strenuous activities done since the
last long rest.  
**Strenuous Activities**  
<ul><li>1 hour of walk</li><li>a fight</li><li>casting a
spell</li></ul></blockquote>  
<h3>Going back to encumbrance</h3>Now that I have a rough definition of
what is a strenuous activity and that I have a rough idea of how much a
character could perform in a day without rest. I'm ready to look at how
to incorporate encumbrance in this system.  
  
Since my list of strenuous activities already includes walking, I'm
tempted to say that performing strenuous activities while wearing an
heavy armor, or carrying a medium to heavy load, make that activity more
strenuous, and thous count as more than one against the "limit per day".

  
The simplest way of doing so is the following :  
<ul><li>Wearing an Heavy armor or carrying an heavy load, while
performing a strenuous activity, make that activity count as three (3)
for determining exhaustion.</li><li>Wearing an Heavy armor, but while
meeting the armor's strength prerequisite, or carrying an medium load,
while performing a strenuous activity, make that activiy count as two
(2) for determining exhaustion.�� </li></ul>That way, a average human
(10 in all stats) would be able to walk in a full plate for about 3
hours before starting to feel exhaustion kicking in. (3*3 (for not
meeting the strength prerequisite) = 9 vs 10 (constitution score)).   
  
On the other hand, a character with 15 in Strength and 14 in
constitution (a regular level 1 fighter) would be able� to wear it and
walk with it for 7 hours before starting to make exhaustion saving
throws. Or� (7*2 (for meeting the strength prerequisite) vs 14
(constitution score)).  
  
Sounds good to me.  
<h2>The actual house rule</h2><h3>Strenuous Activites</h3><ul><li>A
character can make a number of strenuous activities in a day equals to
it's Constitution score before facing exhaustion.</li><li>For each
strenuous activities done beyond that, the character has to perform a
Constitution saving throw vs the number of strenuous activity performed
that day. If he failed, the character gain one level of
exhaustion.</li></ul><h4>List of strenuous activities</h4><ul><li>1 hour
of walk</li><li>fighting</li><li>casting spells</li></ul><h4>Strenuous
activities modifiers </h4>Some condition can make strenuous activities
more exhausting.  
<ul><li>carrying a medium load (x2) </li><li>carrying a heavy load
(x3)</li><li>wearing an heavy armor (x2)</li><li>wearing an heavy armor,
without meeting the strength prerequisite (x3)</li></ul><h3>Expending
the strenuous activities</h3>With that sub-system ready, we now have a
simple way to handle other things that would be exhausting, like sleep
deprivation for example.
