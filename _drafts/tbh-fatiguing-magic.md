I dislike any spell system that use "memory" as the basis of their balance. It affect my [suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) and thus  My memory don't usually start to forget things I just used ... It tends to forget things I rarely use ...

When I saw that memory was used ad a balancing mechanisim 
 
Mana is a better fit naratively, but mechanicaly it goes against the simplicity of resources management of TBH.

Another way of balancing out magic spells is to use  _fatigue_. True20 and the Iron Kingdoms RPG both uses fatigue as a moderation mechanism. If you cast too much spells you become fatigued and can't cast anymore.
 
I personally thing that Mana system are trying to emulate fatigue but missing the mark. Mana representing what you can do  _before_  getting fatigued. And that when you don't have any Mana left your are too much exhausted to cast any spells.
 
That's why I think that  _fatiguing magic_  is even more interesting narratively speaking. It allow a bunch of great tropes.

# Magic in The Black Hack

I was a little disapointed to see that The Black Hack was using memory as a 
 
The current mechanism as the advantage to include both your caster ability and the level of the spell in the calculation. But it also requires some additional bookkeeping to remember which spells were previously cast.
 
**Fatigue** in The Black Hack is only refered once, in the random encounter table.
 
> All Characters must consume food and water or lose HP equal to their Level through **fatigue**

So it _literally_ took the same text to emulate fatigue in my house rule.
