I dislike when RPG system uses _memory_ as an excuse to apply some balance on their magic system. It attacks my [suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) and affect negatively the experience while playing it.

The reason is quite simple : 
* My memory don't usually start to forget things I just used ... It tends to forget things I rarely use ...
* My memory cannot remember multiple time the same information

So when I saw that memory was used as a balancing mechanisim in [The Black Hack](/tags/TheBlackHack) I was a little bit disapointed. I gave the game a chance and decided that if my players didn't I could get over it.

But they openly said that they think it didn't make sense, so now I had to fix it.

# What would be better

So [casting spells and forgetting about them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic) as you do don't please my group taste. What would now ? 

The obvious alternative is to use [**Mana**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana).  It is a better fit naratively, but mechanicaly it goes against the simplicity of resources management of The Black Hack.

Another way of balancing out magic spells is to use  _fatigue_.  [True20](https://greenroninstore.com/collections/true20) and the [Iron Kingdoms RPG](https://store.privateerpress.com/games/iron-kingdoms-rpg) both uses fatigue as a moderation mechanism :

* If you cast too much spells you become fatigued and can't cast anymore.
 
I personally thing that Mana system are trying to emulate fatigue but they miss the mark. Mana represents what you can do  _before_  getting fatigued. And that when you don't have any Mana left your are too much exhausted to cast any spells. 
 
That's why I think that  _fatiguing magic_  is even more interesting narratively speaking. It allow a bunch of great tropes. Like :
* [Power Strain Blackout](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout)
* [Heroic Red Ring of Death](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD)


# What to keep 

## From the spell casting system 

###  MEMORISING SPELLS
Most spellcasting classes have a way to memorise spells. If I don't want to rewrite every classes that I'm gonna use, I have to keep this mechanism.

### CASTING SPELLS

The rules make a distinction between casting spells from memory and from spell book. When casting spells from memory you have a increasing chance to forget it but you can cast spells from your spell book.

Both mechanism have the advantage to include both your caster ability and the level of the spell in the calculation. But it also requires some additional bookkeeping to remember which spells were previously cast.

Rolling on the Magical Side Effects table is fun, I want to keep that.
 
## From the Fatigue system
 
**Fatigue** in The Black Hack is only refered once, in the random encounter table.
 
> All Characters must consume food and water or lose HP equal to their Level through **fatigue**

So to emulate fatigue in The Black Hack, without introducing new rules and mechanism, character should lose HP when they start to get fatigued

# Other considerations

I'd like the house rule to stay compatible with both core and third party classes.

The house rule has to be simple, I can't write a 30 pages house rule for a 20 pages rule book.




# The final house rule

So this is what I came up with. It repalce a single section of the rule books and stays broadly compatible with third party classes and everything.

## CASTING SPELLS

 A Spellcaster can spend an **_Action_** on their Turn to **attempt to**  cast a spell or prayer from memory or by reading it from a book or scroll, when **_Turns_** are being tracked using **_Minutes_**.

To do so they must make an **_Attribute Test_** - adding the spell’s or prayer’s level to the roll. If they succeed, the spell is cast. 

If they fail, the **_Player_** as to chooses between :
* _letting the magical energy loose_ and rolling on the **_Magical Side Effects_** table (p.43 in the main rule book)
* _forcing the spell to work_ but lose **_HP_** equal to their **_Level_** through fatigue

A Spellcaster can only cast spells with level up to and equal to their Level.

Arcane spells use Intelligence and prayers use Wisdom for all Attribute Tests.
