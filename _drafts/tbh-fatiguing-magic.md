I dislike when RPG system uses _memory_ as an excuse to apply some balance on their magic system. It attacks my [suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) and affect negatively the experience while playing it.

The reason is quite simple : 
* My memory don't usually start to forget things I just used ... It tends to forget things I rarely use ...
* My memory cannot remember multiple time the same information

So when I saw that memory was used as a balancing mechanisim in [The Black Hack](/tags/TheBlackHack) I was a little bit disapointed. I gave the game a chance and decided that if my players didn't I could get over it.

But they openly said that they think it didn't make sense, so now I had to fix it.

# What would be better

So [casting spells and forgetting about them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic) as you do don't please my group taste. What would now ? 

The obvious alternative is to use [**Mana**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana).  It is a better fit naratively, but mechanicaly it goes against the simplicity of resources management of The Black Hack.

Another way of balancing out magic spells is to use  _fatigue_.  [True20](https://greenroninstore.com/collections/true20) and the [Iron Kingdoms RPG](https://store.privateerpress.com/games/iron-kingdoms-rpg) both uses fatigue as a moderation mechanism :

* If you cast too much spells you become fatigued and can't cast anymore.
 
I personally thing that Mana system are trying to emulate fatigue but they miss the mark. Mana represents what you can do  _before_  getting fatigued. And that when you don't have any Mana left your are too much exhausted to cast any spells. 
 
That's why I think that  _fatiguing magic_  is even more interesting narratively speaking. It allow a bunch of great tropes. Like :
* [Power Strain Blackout](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout)
* [Heroic Red Ring of Death](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD)


# What to keep 

## From the spell casting system 

The current mechanism as the advantage to include both your caster ability and the level of the spell in the calculation. But it also requires some additional bookkeeping to remember which spells were previously cast.
 
## From the Fatigue system
 
**Fatigue** in The Black Hack is only refered once, in the random encounter table.
 
> All Characters must consume food and water or lose HP equal to their Level through **fatigue**

So to emulate fatigue in The Black Hack, without introducing new rules and mechanism, character should lose HP when they start to get fatigued
