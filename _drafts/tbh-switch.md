With my group of old timers, we recently switched from Cypher System to [The Black Hack Second Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to handle our RPG cravings. 

We did so for many reasons :
* character options were a little bit to heavy for their tastes
* character creation tooked too much time
* they had a hard time to remember the rules

Let me extrapolate, because it might help others who are in the same situation

## Character options

The Cypher System is _full_ of character options. At first, we we switched to this system, I thought that my players would love this. With the combinaisons of the _Descriptors_, _Types_ and _Foci_ you can create a great deal of characters concept.

The issue was that none of my player had time/interest in their personal life to sitdown and read through all thoses options to create a character.  As
