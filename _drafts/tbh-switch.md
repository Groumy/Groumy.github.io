With my group of old timers, we recently switched from Cypher System to [The Black Hack Second Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to handle our RPG cravings. 

We did so for many reasons :
* character options were a little bit to heavy for their tastes
* character creation tooked too much time
* they had a hard time to remember
