With my group of old timers, we recently switched from Cypher System to [The Black Hack Second Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to handle our RPG cravings. 

We did so for many reasons :
* [character options](#character-options) were a little bit to heavy for their tastes
* [character creation](#character-creation) tooked too much time
* they had a hard time to remember [the rules](#the-rules)

We ended up choosing The Black Hack because it checked all the boxes of their needs and my needs.

Let me extrapolate, because it might help others who are in the same situation and lets start by describing the group.

# Our group

To describe our group I'm gonna steel the Cypher System concept of _character as a sentence_ and apply it to my players ;)

Our group is composed of  :
* 6 **Old timers Parents** _that_ **Aren't a RPG Geek**
* my daughter a **Young Teenager** _that_ **Aren't a RPG Geek**
* myself a **Old timer Parent** _that_ **Definetly is a RPG Geek**

And here some _definition_ of those terms for me : 

* **Old timers**, most of my players have over 20 years of playing RPG under their belt
* **Parents**, most of my players are parents and thus a busy schedule, including me
* **Aren't RPG Geek**, _none_ of players invest any of their precious time to read about RPG (_not even rules_). The only time they dedicate to RPG is while they are sitting at my table. They _love_ playing, but not _reading_ about RPGs.

Because of all that, we play mostly once a month with a varying degree of participations. Some are present each time, other have played only two session in over 2 years for example. 

# My player needs

Based on discussion and observations of their reactions when we discussed changing campaign heres the issues my players had with the Cypher System.

## Character options

The Cypher System is _full_ of character options. At first, we we switched to this system, I thought that my players would love this. With the combinaisons of the _Descriptors_, _Types_ and _Foci_ you can create a great deal of characters concept.

The issue was that none of my player had time/interest in their personal life to sitdown and read through all thoses options to create a character.  And it was worst if they already had a character concept in mind.

With all the character options available through the differents Cyper System products, it appears that finding the proper combinaison of _Descriptor_, _Type_ and _Focus_ to actually create the character you wanted becomes quite difficult.

So all that lead to decision paralysis at character creation and each tier advancement. 

**They needed less character options.**

## Character creation

Since most of my players are adult with real life responsabilities to handle, the occasion to actually play the game are limited. 

None of them like the fact that each time we changed campaign, it took a full night to just create the characters.

**They needed a system were creating a new character could be done in minutes, not hours.** 

## The rules 

Even after playing over a year of Cypher System, none of my player could grasp the action resolution mechanisim.

They were always confused about the relation between the difficulty level and the d20 and don't get me started with the difficulty level _negotiation_ or the _stat pool management_. They simply forgot about those rules between sessions.
 
 **They needed rules that can be learned in minutes and easily remembered.**

# My own needs

So as their GM and and the only RPG Geek at the table, I started to look at different systems. I soon realized that I had to consider my needs too. They were reasons that made me choose the Cypher System some years ago. So I kept in mind those point :
* Player facing rolls
* One stat ennemy
* One unified action resolution mechanisim

## Player facing rolls

I love player facing rolls, because I found it easier on me and I have the impression that it empowers the players.
