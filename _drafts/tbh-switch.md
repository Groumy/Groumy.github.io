With my group of old timers, we recently switched from Cypher System to [The Black Hack Second Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to handle our RPG cravings. 

We did so for many reasons :
* [character options](#character-options) were a little bit to heavy for their tastes
* [character creation](#character-creation) tooked too much time
* they had a hard time to remember [the rules](#the-rules)

Let me extrapolate, because it might help others who are in the same situation and lets start by describing the group.

## Our group

Our group is composed of : 

* **Old timers**, most (_6 out of 7_) of my players have over 20 years of playing RPG under their belt
* **Parents**, most (_6 out of 7 again_) of my players are parents and thus a busy schedule, including me
* **RPG enthusiast, not fanatics**

## Character options

The Cypher System is _full_ of character options. At first, we we switched to this system, I thought that my players would love this. With the combinaisons of the _Descriptors_, _Types_ and _Foci_ you can create a great deal of characters concept.

The issue was that none of my player had time/interest in their personal life to sitdown and read through all thoses options to create a character.  And it was worst if they already had a character concept in mind.

With all the character options available through the differents Cyper System products, it appears that finding the proper combinaison of _Descriptor_, _Type_ and _Focus_ to actually create the character you wanted becomes quite difficult.

So all that lead to decision paralysis at character creation and each tier advancement. 

## Character creation

Since most of my players are adult with real life responsabilities to handle, the occasion to actually play the game are limited. 

None of them like the fact that each time we changed campaign, it took a full night to just create the characters.

They wanted a system were creating a new character could be done in minutes, not hours. 

## The rules 

Even after playing over a year of Cypher System, none of my player could grasp the action resolution mechanisim.

They were always confused about the relation between the difficulty level and the d20 and don't get me started with the difficulty level _negotiation_ or the _stat pool management_.

With each time
