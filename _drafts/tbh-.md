In [The Black Hack Additional Things document](http://dngnsndrgns.blogspot.com/2016/05/additional-things.html)  David Black state in one of the side notes that :

> [...] _one of the main goals I set myself when designing The Black Hack was to remove 'repetitive dice roll modifiers' entirely, which I think Iâ€™ve almost managed to do_ [...]

 succeeded in general, but not completely and there's a couple of rules that requires players to add some values to their rolls :
 * Powerfull Foe
 * Banishing Undead
 * Casting Spells
 Those rules comes up relatively often at my table and every time I see my players taking time to think before they roll :
 * Subtracting the number to add to their attribute score so they know what to get on their dice
 So I was thinking there should be a way of doing it differently.




# Beat the odds
When a rule in The Black Hack ask you to _add a number_ to an attribute test, you simply have to roll _higher_ than the given number _and_ under your attribute.

> Statistically they have the same odds, but mathematically you don't have to do anything.

> You simply have to make an _Attribute Test_ **and** _beat_ a given number.

## Difficulty Levels

When characters attempt a task that's more difficult then usual, the GM can pick an appropriate difficulty level form  1 to 10 and require the players to _beat it_ with an _Attribute Test_.

> Now that we have a simpler way of handling those case without math, the idea of using it more often comes to mind.

> Basically those three rules are hiding a difficulty level subsystem. One that kind of range from 1 to 10

## What about Critical hits ?
Changing the way we interpret the die rolls impact critical hits.
