In [The Black Hack Additional Things document](http://dngnsndrgns.blogspot.com/2016/05/additional-things.html)  David Black state in one of the side notes that :

> [...] _one of the main goals [he] set [himself] when designing The Black Hack was to remove 'repetitive dice roll modifiers' entirely, which [he] think [he's] almost managed to do_ [...]

I agree that he _almost managed to do it_ but in The Black Hack Second Edition there's still some rules that requires players to add some values to their rolls. Those are : 
 * Powerfull Foe
 * Banishing Undead
 * Casting Spells

At my table, those rule are often used and every time I see my players taking time to think before they roll. Their train of thought are usually like this :
 * Subtracting the modifer to their attribute score so they know what to get on their dice
 
They could also simply roll, then add the modifier, but for [some reasons]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

This got me thinking that there probably a different way of doing it. 

# Basic Math

So when you _add a number_ to a roll, basicaly what you are doing is reducing the range of die face that result in a success. And thus reducing your chances of success.

Let's take an example :

> A mediocre Wizard with **10 in intelligence** cast a **1 first level spell** from it's spell book.
> 
> Normaly this Wizard would have to 9 or less on a d10. That's 9 possibilities of success. Or 45% chances of success. 
> If we say that he now have to add 1 to this roll, the value of 9 is no longer a success, as it raise the total to 10. He now have 8 possibilities of 

# The Blackjack rule
When a rule in The Black Hack ask you to _add a number_ to an attribute test, you simply have to roll _higher_ than the given number _and_ under your attribute.

> Statistically they have the same odds, but mathematically you don't have to do anything.
> 
> You simply have to make an _Attribute Test_ **and** _beat_ a given number.

## Difficulty Levels

When characters attempt a task that's more difficult then usual, the GM can pick an appropriate difficulty level form  1 to 10 and require the players to _beat it_ with an _Attribute Test_.

> Now that we have a simpler way of handling those case without math, the idea of using it more often comes to mind.
> 
> Basically those three rules are hiding a difficulty level subsystem. One that kind of range from 1 to 10

## What about Critical hits ?
Changing the way we interpret the die rolls impact critical hits.
