In [The Black Hack Additional Things document](http://dngnsndrgns.blogspot.com/2016/05/additional-things.html)  David Black state in one of the side notes that :

> [...] _one of the main goals [he] set [himself] when designing The Black Hack was to remove 'repetitive dice roll modifiers' entirely, which [he] think [he's] almost managed to do_ [...]

I agree that he _almost_ managed to do it and in The Black Hack Second Edition there's still some rules that requires players to apply modifiers to their rolls. Those are : 
 * Powerfull Foe
 * Banishing Undead
 * Casting Spells

At my table, those rules comes up often. And  every time I see my players taking time to think before they roll. They take the time to subtract the modifer to their attribute score so they know what to get on their dice.
 
They could also simply roll, then add the modifier, but for [some reasons]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

This got me thinking that there probably a different way of doing it. 

# Simple Math

So when you _add a number_ to a roll, basicaly what you are doing is reducing the range of die faces that would result in a success. And thus reducing your chances of success.

Let's take an example :

> An average Wizard with **11 in intelligence** cast a **1 first level spell** from it's spell book.
> 
> Normaly this Wizard would have to roll  10 or less on a d20. That's 10 possibilities of success  [_1 to 10_]. Or 50% chances of success. 
> If we say that he now have to add 1 to this roll, the value of 10 is no longer a success, as it raise the total to 11. He now have 9 possibilities of success, or 45%.

That range as a minimum (1) and a maximum (10) and the _usual_ way of handling modifier is to affect the value rolled and thus reduce the maximum number we can roll. 

Now, what if instead we alter the minimum value we can roll ? 

In our previous example, the range of possible values starts at 1 and end at 10. 



# The Blackjack rule
When a rule in The Black Hack ask you to _add a number_ to an attribute test, you simply have to roll _higher_ than the given number _and_ under your attribute.

> Statistically they have the same odds, but mathematically you don't have to do anything.
> 
> You simply have to make an _Attribute Test_ **and** _beat_ a given number.

## Difficulty Levels

When characters attempt a task that's more difficult then usual, the GM can pick an appropriate difficulty level form  1 to 10 and require the players to _beat it_ with an _Attribute Test_.

> Now that we have a simpler way of handling those case without math, the idea of using it more often comes to mind.
> 
> Basically those three rules are hiding a difficulty level subsystem. One that kind of range from 1 to 10

## What about Critical hits ?
Changing the way we interpret the die rolls impact critical hits.
