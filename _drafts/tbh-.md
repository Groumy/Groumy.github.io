In [The Black Hack Additional Things document](http://dngnsndrgns.blogspot.com/2016/05/additional-things.html)  David Black state in one of the side notes that :

> [...] _one of the main goals [he] set [himself] when designing The Black Hack was to remove 'repetitive dice roll modifiers' entirely, which [he] think [he's] almost managed to do_ [...]

I agree that he _almost managed to do it_ but in The Black Hack Second Edition there's still some rules that requires players to add some values to their rolls. Those are : 
 * Powerfull Foe
 * Banishing Undead
 * Casting Spells

At my table, those rule are often used and every time I see my players taking time to think before they roll. Their train of thought are usually like this :
 * Subtracting the modifer to their attribute score so they know what to get on their dice
 
They could also simply roll, then add the modifier, but for [some reasons]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url

This got me thinking that there probably a different way of doing it. 

# How other Hacks handles it

So I started to look at different hack of The Black Hack to see if any brilliant people outhere altered that mechanism if any. I didn't found a lot of hacks based on the 



# Beat the odds
When a rule in The Black Hack ask you to _add a number_ to an attribute test, you simply have to roll _higher_ than the given number _and_ under your attribute.

## Difficulty Levels

When characters attempt a task that's more difficult then usual, the GM can pick an appropriate difficulty level form  1 to 10 and require the players to _beat it_ with an _Attribute Test_.

## What about Critical hits ?
Changing the way we interpret the die rolls impact critical hits.
