In [The Black Hack Additional Things document](http://dngnsndrgns.blogspot.com/2016/05/additional-things.html)  David Black state in one of the side notes that :

> [...] _one of the main goals [he] set [himself] when designing The Black Hack was to remove 'repetitive dice roll modifiers' entirely, which [he] think [he's] almost managed to do_ [...]

I agree that he _almost_ managed to do it and in The Black Hack Second Edition there's still some rules that requires players to apply modifiers to their rolls. Those are : 
 * Powerfull Foe
 * Banishing Undead
 * Casting Spells

At my table, those rules comes up often. And  every time I see my players taking time to think before they roll. They take the time to subtract the modifer to their attribute score so they know what to get on their dice.
 
They could also simply roll, then add the modifier, but for some reasons they seems to like to know what number they have to roll before they do.  

This got me thinking that there probably a different way of doing it. 

# Simple Math

So when you _add a number_ to a roll, basicaly what you are doing is reducing the range of die faces that would result in a success. And thus reducing your chances of success.

Let's take an example :

> Jimmy, an average Wizard with **11 in intelligence** cast a **1 first level spell** from it's spell book.
> 
> Normaly this Wizard would have to roll  10 or less on a d20. That's 10 possibilities of success  [_1 to 10_]. Or 50% chances of success. 

That range as a minimum value (1) and a maximum value (10) and the _usual_ way of handling modifier is to affect the value rolled and thus reduce the maximum number we can roll. 

> If we say that he now have to add 1 to this roll, the value of 10 is no longer a success, as it raise the total to 11. He now have 9 possibilities of success, or 45%.

Now, what if instead we alter the minimum value we can roll ? 

> If we add the modifier to the lowest value we can roll, we would then have a range of 2 to 10. Which is sill 9 possibilities of success and is exactly the same odds. 

But, I find it simpler to say that Jimmy the Wizard, as to roll bellow his stat **and** above the spell level than having to calculate what it's the maximum he is allowed to roll.

## What about Critical hits ?

If we apply this rules to the Powerful Foe rule, player's won't be able to roll Critical Hits anymore when attacking an opponent with higher HD than their own, as the they will have to roll above their differences in HD on the D20.

For some it might be ok that since the foe is more powerful than you, you just can't criticaly hit it, but for most players they will have the impression we have robbed them ... 

A simple fix is to move the Critical Hit value at the other end of the possible range of success, and thus :

> **When you roll the number juset bellow your attribute it's a critical hit.**

# The house rule

When a rule in The Black Hack ask you to _add a number_ to an attribute test, you simply have to roll _higher_ than the given number _and_ under your attribute.

## Difficulty Levels

When characters attempt a task that's more difficult then usual, the GM can pick an appropriate difficulty level form  1 to 10 and require the players to _beat it_ with an _Attribute Test_.

> Now that we have a simpler way of handling those case without math, the idea of using it more often comes to mind.
> 
> Basically those three rules are hiding a difficulty level subsystem. One that kind of range from 1 to 10
