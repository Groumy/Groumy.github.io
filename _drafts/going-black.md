title: Going Black

---

With my group, we recently switched from the [Cypher System](http://cypher-system.com/) to [The Black Hack Second Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to handle our RPG cravings. 

We did so for many reasons that I'm going to explain, because it might help others who are in the same situation.


# Our group

Let's start by describing our group, because it's important to understand a decision to understand the context in which it was made.

To describe our group I'm gonna steel the Cypher System concept of _character as a sentence_ and apply it to my players ;)

Our group is composed of  :
* 6 **Old timers Parents** _that_ **Aren't a RPG Geek**
* my daughter a **Young Teenager** _that_ **Aren't a RPG Geek**
* myself a **Old timer Parent** _that_ **Definetly is a RPG Geek**

And here some _definition_ of those terms for me : 

* **Old timers**, most of my players have over 20 years of playing RPG under their belt
* **Parents**, most of my players are parents and thus a busy schedule, including me
* **Aren't RPG Geek**, _none_ of players invest any of their precious time to read about RPG (_not even rules_). The only time they dedicate to RPG is while they are sitting at my table. They _love_ playing, but not _reading_ about RPGs.

Because of all that, we play mostly once a month with a varying degree of participations. Some are present each time, other have played only two session in over 2 years for example. 

# My player needs

Based on discussion and observations of their reactions when we discussed changing campaign here's the issues my players had with the Cypher System :

* [character options](#character-options) were a little bit to heavy for their tastes
* [character creation](#character-creation) tooked too much time (_probably related to the number of character options and decision paralysis_)
* they had a hard time to remember [the rules](#the-rules)

Let's discuss each one in length.

## Character options

The Cypher System is _full_ of character options. At first, when we switched to this system, I thought that my players would love this.  With the combinaisons of the _Descriptors_, _Types_ and _Foci_ you can create a great deal of characters concept.

With all the character options available through the differents Cyper System products, it appears that finding the proper combinaison of _Descriptor_, _Type_ and _Focus_ to actually create the character you wanted becomes quite difficult.

It seems easier to read the options and use them as an inspiration to create a unique character than to try to fit them to a concept.

And it appears that none of my player had time/interest in their personal life to sitdown and read through all thoses options to create a character.  And as seasoned players they usually were able to came up with a concept base on know tropes in seconds.

We had some success when we played a _Numenera_ campaign around the Jade Colossus. As our first game with the system and the setting we used pregenerated characters. So they took what was available. But when we switched to playing a Shadowrun inspired campaign with the Cypher System. We didn't had any pregenerated characters and 

So all that lead to decision paralysis at character creation and each tier advancement after that.

**They needed less character options.**

## Character creation

Since most of my players are adult with real life responsabilities to handle, the occasion to actually play the game are limited. 

None of them like the fact that each time we changed campaign, it took a full night to just create the characters.

**They needed a system were creating a new character could be done in minutes, not hours.** 

## The rules 

Even after playing over a year of Cypher System, none of my player could grasp the action resolution mechanisim.

They were always confused about the relation between the difficulty level and the d20 and don't get me started with the difficulty level _negotiation_ or the _stat pool management_. They simply forgot about those rules between sessions.
 
 **They needed rules that can be learned in minutes and easily remembered.**

# My own needs

So as their GM and and the only RPG Geek at the table, I started to look at different systems. I soon realized that I had to consider my needs too. They were reasons that made me choose the Cypher System some years ago. So I kept in mind those point :
* Player facing rolls
* One stat ennemy
* One unified action resolution mechanisim

## Player facing rolls

I love player facing rolls, because I found it easier on me and I have the impression that it empowers the players.

There's a difference between getting hit by the BBEG because :
* I (_a player_) rolled poorly on my dodge attempt; vs
* the GM said so (_rolling dice behind the screen doesn't matter for the players and rolling in the open doesn't either unless the players have access to the NPS stat blocks ..._)

With players making all the rolls, there is simply no bullshit, no fudging dice, no GM fiat.

## One stat enemy

One thing I _loved_ about the Cypher System (_and other RPGs I have contemplated over the years_) was to be able to simply express enemy, _and any challenge really_, as a single number in my notes.

Back when we played DND 4th I hated to have to spend so much time trying to balance out encounter, read monsters stat blocks, reference those blocks in game, etc.

Being able to express NPC and the like as a single number is so freeing. It also facilitate improvisation at the table. 

## One unified action resolution mechanisim

One thing I know I don't love is evry action having it's own set of rules. Yes, I'm looking at you AD&D.

I alway appreciated system that are basically driven simply by Attribute Tests and other subsystem simply modify the Attribute Test, like Cypher System.

# The verdict

After some searching I stumbled on The Black Hack. Put simply it checked all the boxes for our group. 

We have now 5 sessions under the belt running [Barrowmaze Complete](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete) with it and we have only minor issues that can easly be fixed with house rules. 

The first session, it tooked maybe 30 minutes to explains the rules and create characters, then started playing..

All the player stated how much simpler this system was, we no longer have questions about how to resolve actions or anything. The mood ligthened up a bit also and everybody is starting to have more fun.

When group member that weren't there on the first session showed up we were able to explain the rules and create that character in under 15 minutes. 

Since we made the switch we even welcomed two new recruits. My wife and the significant other of one of the player. Those two were able to play fast and grasp the system really well even if they are new to the hobby.

We might still my on the honeymoon period, but it starts great !
