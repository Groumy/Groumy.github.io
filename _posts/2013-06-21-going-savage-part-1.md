After being a DnD 4th enthusiast for a long time, as in the day it was
released, I got bored of it and my players too at some times in 2011.
Some of them was nostalgic of good old DnD 3.5. Some of them was not
combat players, so wasn't very interested in Dnd 4th character options.
Some of them, who recently joined the campaign, was overwhelmed by all
the powers they had and never knew witch one does what.  

Just to be clear, it's not a Dnd 4th hater article, it's just
recollection of the events that brought me and my group to where we are
and I do that to help other that may feel the same way as we did to find
an alternative.  
  
So by the end 2011 summer I start looking for alternative. I tried in
the past Mutants and Masterminds and felled in love with [Green
Ronin][1]'s product. So I figured that I could give a go with their's
[True20 ][2]product line.  
  
True20, as is name implies, use only a d20. You don't need any other
dice to play the game and you'll need only a single d20 per player. It's
based on the d20 system, with skills, feats and tree classes (Warrior,
Expert, Adept) that servers more as a template than actual classes.
Every class abilities you are used to see in a d20 system are feats in
True20, as racial abilities. So in fact your thief can, as he go up
levels take a feat that grant him dark vision. One other major
difference with True20 is that it does not uses HP, but Damage vs
Toughness rolls that determines if you were barely hit or mortally
wounded. And it comes with a Hero Point, something like Action Points of
DnD 4th, but with more options to it.  
  
Since it's based on d20 I knew it will be much more interesting for my
players that where nostalgic of Dnd 3.5 and the fact that there was no
predefined classes just generic ones appealed to me and some of my
players because it give them the power to create the character they want
and where not limited to predefined stuff.  
  
I know you can do that with any RPG system (even DnD 4th), but a system
that is classless will force the player to approach the character
creation process with the concept first and the rules set after. How
many times did we saw a players about to create a new character look at
the core rule book and pick a class from it as the first step and not
ask them self what the character will do than look at the rule book to
see how to make it happens ? If the answer is always like me you'll
understand my point.  
  
One more point that got me interested in True20 was the setting free
approach. In place of giving you rule sets that fit a specific setting
and becomes hard to steer away from it (imagine playing DnD 4th edition
in a home brew campaign world that as low magic in it, it will require
massive rethinking and tinkering from the DM's part). True20 offers
basic rule set, and gives out optional rules that you can include in
your world to flesh it out. A whole chapter is there to help you put
together your own world and help you think about all the rules and thing
you should use. I also loved the prices of the products and the fact
that they offered a pocket format book aimed for the players that is
sold for less than 10$ and is only missing the Game mastering chapter.  
  
The campaign went well, but the player got confuse with the toughness
saves of the True20 system, One almost died at the first encounter
because he didn't understand well enough how the game worked and put not
enough toughness for his fighter. Also they never get over the idea that
they didn't need any other dice than a d20. In retrospective I should
have run a test run with pre-generated characters so the player cold
understand how the system worked and it would have helped them with
making there actual characters.  
  
We put that campaign on hold, seeing that the players weren't very
enthusiast with the system when the DnD Next play test started. We
switch to the play test with the options of changing the campaign to
that system if the players loved it. They do loved it, but I moved out
of town, going to the suburbs and some player founded that to far and so
we stopped both campaign (DnD Next play test and the True20 one).  
  
DnD Next was promising, but had very limited options back then and I'm
not the kind of GM that like to create a whole lot of home brew rules.
So I continued to look out for alternative RPG system. I was searching
something that was setting free like True20, if possible with wounds
systems like True20 since I really enjoyed using it. And if possible,
isn't based on d20. After playing with only d20 in True20, I realized
are "swingy" they can be, and you end up most of the time having great
success or great failure and not very much of medium rolls.  
  
That's how I came to discover [Savage Worlds][3], by [Pinnacle
Entertainment Group][4](PEG). Since this post is long enough, Savage
Worlds will be explain in the next part.
