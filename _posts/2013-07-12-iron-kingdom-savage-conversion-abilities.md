Welcome to my third installment on Iron Kingdoms RPG conversion to
Savage Worlds. In that post, I'll cover Iron Kingdom RPG Abilities.

The Iron Kingdoms RPG offer a lot of abilities to character. Abilities
really are the IKRPG equivalent of Savage Worlds edges. The main
differences, is that characters in IKRPG have limited availability of
abilities based on their careers and archetype.

I'll do the same process as I did for the skills last week. I'll try to
map IKRPG abilities to existing Savage Worlds edges. If I can't find a
fitting match, I'll create a new Edge, but only if the ability his a
setting signature, like 'Jack Marshal that allows a character to handle
steamjack.

So here is my mapping table of every abilities from IKRPG.

As you can see, there is really few Edges that are equivalent to the
IKRPG Abilities. There's a lot of abilities that allows character to
reroll failed skill checked and since Savage Worlds include bennies that
allows that I don't see the need to create them. There's also some
abilities that could be created as is in Savage Worlds, for example
Truth Reader that allows a character to always know if someone is lying.

Since I'm not converting an existing IKRPG campaing, I don't intend to
create mapping for every one of the abilities. My principal goals for
this conversion is to take out what create the flavor of the Iron
Kingdoms and to allows me to convert ennemy stat block easily. So if I
decide to use an ennemy with an ability that doesn't have an edge
equivalent, I'll convert it then.

Some Iron Kingdoms Abilities are mapped as new Edges, these new Edges
will be the subject of an other post.
