You may have noticed that I imported a couple on month ago the stuff of my old blog [Goumy.net](https://groumy.blogspot.com).

I was primarily because I stopped registering my custom domain (_groumy.net_) and wanted to be able to work on draft posts from my phone. As a father of five children, I realised that I had less time to sit down and write ... go figure why ! ;) 

I choose to use [Jekyll hosted on github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) basically because I love to work in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). As a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developpemer I know I'll be able to tinker with the layout and everything.

It took time though to find a proper markdown editor that would work on my phone, my personnal compuler and my professional one (_we have some heavy limitation on what we can run and access_). For the curious, [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) is the app that's working for me.

Now that I've found my Markdown editor, imported me previous blog posts, finished setting up [Categories](/categories) and [Tags](/tags) pages and adjusting the layout of this blog, I'm ready to start writing again. Don't expect new posts every day, but I every few weeks is probable.

Speaking of categories, I'm planning to use a few. [Blog-Meta](/categories
