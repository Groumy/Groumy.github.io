On of my player brought to my attention a new RPG that came out last year and that was looking very interesting. The RPG was <a href="http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms">Iron Kingdom</a> from <a href="http://privateerpress.com/">Privateer Press</a>. This RPG is a new system derived from Privateer Press' <a href="http://privateerpress.com/warmachine">Warmachine</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://privateerpress.com/hordes">Hordes</a>&nbsp;miniature games that lives in the same settig. Privateer Press published some years ago a d20 compatible version of their Iron Kingdoms campaign setting.<br /><br />Personally, when my player shows me the core rule book cover I was hooked even if I never heard of that game world before. Here's the cover :<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://privateerpress.com/files/products/IKRPG%20Core%20Rules%20Cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://privateerpress.com/files/products/IKRPG%20Core%20Rules%20Cover.jpg" width="242" /></a></div><br />And then when you read the back of the book, it get's even better :<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Embark upon a journey of adventure and intrigue in a steam-powered world fueled by magic and contested with gunfire and steel. Armed with mechanika and accompanied by mighty steamjacks, explore the soot-covered cities of the Iron Kingdoms and the fell ruins of ancient powers.</blockquote><br />That kind of world really appeals to me, as a game master I see so much potential. From classic fantasy adventure to full fledged politic game or urban criminal campaign or may be "shadowrunner" like game, working for big manufacturing company.<br /><br />So I grabbed a coy of the book and start to read about the Iron Kingdoms. The book is really well made, the first chapters are all about the basic lore of the world and are really well written. Then it's about character creation and the rules to play the game.When I came to the rules I start reading than realized that I didn't want to learn a knew RPG system, I just started to game master <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-06-20-going-savage-part-2 %}">Savage Worlds</a> and I was loving it.<br /><br />At that time, I had only ran four sessions of Savage Worlds, but already felt confident enough to think that I could convert the whole system of Iron Kingdoms to Savage World with out much efforts.<br /><br />Since I'm a lazy guy, I did look around a bit to see if others done it before me. The answer was yes, but it was from the old d20 version and there were differences in the flavor with the new version from Privateer Press. So, I decided that I'll base my conversion from these resources and create my own.<br /><br />Since nobody published their conversions of the new system, I will do that here. Principally to keep that somewhere out "there" ans secondly to may be help some one who want that conversion like I did, even if it's just to get inspired from.<br /><br />By the time I wrote this article, we already played three session and my basic conversion is almost done. But now I start to see flaws in my conversion, so what I'll post will be my <i>revised</i>&nbsp;edition.
