On of my player brought to my attention a new RPG that came out last
year and that was looking very interesting. The RPG was [Iron
Kingdom][1] from [Privateer Press][2]. This RPG is a new system derived
from Privateer Press' [Warmachine][3] and [Hordes][4] miniature games
that lives in the same settig. Privateer Press published some years ago
a d20 compatible version of their Iron Kingdoms campaign setting.  
  
Personally, when my player shows me the core rule book cover I was
hooked even if I never heard of that game world before. Here's the cover
:  
[![](https://privateerpress.com/files/products/IKRPG%20Core%20Rules%20Cover.jpg)][5]

> Embark upon a journey of adventure and
intrigue in a steam-powered world fueled by magic and contested with
gunfire and steel. Armed with mechanika and accompanied by mighty
steamjacks, explore the soot-covered cities of the Iron Kingdoms and the
fell ruins of ancient powers.

That kind of world really appeals to me, as a game master I see so much
potential. From classic fantasy adventure to full fledged politic game
or urban criminal campaign or may be "shadowrunner" like game, working
for big manufacturing company.  
  
So I grabbed a coy of the book and start to read about the Iron
Kingdoms. The book is really well made, the first chapters are all about
the basic lore of the world and are really well written. Then it's about
character creation and the rules to play the game.When I came to the
rules I start reading than realized that I didn't want to learn a knew
RPG system, I just started to game master [Savage Worlds]({{
site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-06-20-going-savage-part-2 %}) and I was
loving it.  
  
At that time, I had only ran four sessions of Savage Worlds, but already
felt confident enough to think that I could convert the whole system of
Iron Kingdoms to Savage World with out much efforts.  
  
Since I'm a lazy guy, I did look around a bit to see if others done it
before me. The answer was yes, but it was from the old d20 version and
there were differences in the flavor with the new version from Privateer
Press. So, I decided that I'll base my conversion from these resources
and create my own.  
  
Since nobody published their conversions of the new system, I will do
that here. Principally to keep that somewhere out "there" ans secondly
to may be help some one who want that conversion like I did, even if
it's just to get inspired from.  
  
By the time I wrote this article, we already played three session and my
basic conversion is almost done. But now I start to see flaws in my
conversion, so what I'll post will be my *revised*edition.
